Interactive scorecards for sports


Overview

Our goal - To provide a digital, web-based, scorers book. 

While at the collegiate and professional levels have already achieved this, the High School level has not.  We are not going to dive into these reasons, but in short, High Schools lack the manpower and cash flow to obtain these systems, servers, etc. 

This is where we come in. In providing a web-based scores book, we eliminate the cost of purchasing, operating, and maintaining your own server, and minimize the manpower necessary to digitize your game stats.

Currently, in the State of Indiana, the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) requires each basketball team to have an official scorers book.

How does it work?

It is simple. Open up a web browser, login, and start a game. 

The teamâ€™s official scorekeeper will enter in the rosters, and remaining eligible quarters before starting a game. 

Once a game has started, all your score keeper needs to do is click.
